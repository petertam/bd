(NASDAQ:META).\nHe also believes Apple's AI play can move the earnings needle for Cupertino in double-digit percentages.\nWhat Happened: Munster expressed optimism about Apple's AI play, stating that the company's first AI model is expected to be announced sometime in June.\nHowever, investors in 2024 so far have not been very optimistic about Apple's prospects like analysts have.\nSee Also: Gene Munster Suggests Apple Acquire Rivian Following Surprising Cancellation Of Apple Car Project\nHowever, Apple stock itself has not performed as well as it should have if AI is indeed a potential revenue maker for the company.\nIn fact, the Nasdaq Composite has beaten the Apple stock as far as performance in 2024 so far is concerned.\nFull story available on Benzinga.com",
