Executive Summary: This agent help you to make MORE money.

Long version:
News Arbitrage AI : The AI agent will learn
the news pattern for the last 3(?) years,
which correlate the SHARP increase or decrease
of stock price (let's assume SHARP meaning +/-3%
in one day).  The correlation can be one day
or N days (usually a small N < 5).
After learning the correlation of news and stock
SHARP changes for the first 2 years, we
can verify by checking the news third
year whether the learned model is correct,
e.g. we scan the news in the last year,
and predict that SHARP change occurs
or not everyday.   If the model achieve
certain level of correctness, e.g. 70% of
prediction is correct, we can make use of
that to conduct stock trading with a higher
percentage of earning money.

peter: above may change anytime.
