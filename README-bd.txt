Of course. This is an excellent and classic application of AI in finance. Your proposal outlines a clear, logical approach to creating a quantitative trading strategy. Let's break this down into a more detailed and structured plan, highlighting the key components, challenges, and a realistic path forward.
Executive Summary (Refined)
This document outlines a strategic framework for developing a News Arbitrage AI. The primary objective is to generate "alpha" (excess returns) by identifying and acting on statistically significant correlations between public news events and sharp, short-term stock price movements (+/- 3%). While the potential for profit is significant, the project is complex and requires a rigorous approach to data science, financial modeling, and risk management. This agent is not a guaranteed money-making machine but a sophisticated decision-support and signal-generation tool designed to increase the probability of successful trades.
Long Version: A Detailed Project Blueprint
Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the project, expanding on your original idea with key technical details and considerations.
Phase 1: Data Foundation & Infrastructure
This is the most critical phase. The quality of your model will be a direct function of the quality of your data.
News Data Acquisition:
Sources: You need high-quality, machine-readable news feeds.
Premium (Recommended): Bloomberg Terminal API, Reuters News, FactSet, Dow Jones Newswires. These offer low-latency, structured data but are expensive.
Mid-Tier/API-based: NewsAPI.org, Alpaca News API, Polygon.io News. These are more accessible and provide good coverage of major outlets.
Free (For Prototyping): Web scraping public sources like Yahoo Finance, Google News. Warning: This is prone to delays, IP blocks, and changes in website structure. Not suitable for live trading.
Data Points to Collect: For each news item, you need:
Precise Timestamp (down to the millisecond if possible)
Headline
Full Body Text
Source (e.g., Reuters, AP)
Tickers/Companies Mentioned
Market Data Acquisition:
Sources: Alpha Vantage, Polygon.io, IEX Cloud, or directly from your broker's API (e.g., Interactive Brokers, Alpaca).
Granularity: Your proposal mentions daily changes (+/- 3% in one day). To verify the timing of the correlation (was the move after the news?), you will need intraday data (e.g., 1-minute or 5-minute bars).
Data Points to Collect: For each stock and time interval:
Timestamp
Open, High, Low, Close (OHLC)
Volume
Data Preprocessing and Alignment:
Target Variable Definition: Create a new column in your market data. For each day, calculate (Close - Open) / Open. Label it 1 if the result is > 0.03, -1 if < -0.03, and 0 otherwise. This is your sharp_move target.
Timestamp Alignment: This is a major challenge. You must precisely align news events with market data. A news article released at 9:00 AM EST should be correlated with market activity after 9:00 AM EST. You must account for market open/close times and pre/post-market activity.
Text Cleaning: Standard Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline: remove HTML, convert to lowercase, remove stop words (e.g., "the", "a", "is"), and perform stemming or lemmatization (reducing words to their root form).
Phase 2: Model Development & Feature Engineering
This is where the "intelligence" is built.
Feature Engineering (Turning News into Numbers):
Sentiment Analysis: Score the sentiment of each headline and article. Is it positive, negative, or neutral? Using a finance-specific model like FinBERT is far superior to generic sentiment analyzers.
Topic Modeling: Identify the type of news. Is it about an "earnings report," "M&A activity," "clinical trial results," "legal trouble," or a "product launch"? This provides crucial context. Techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) can be used.
Entity Recognition: Extract key entities: company names, executive names, product names. This helps confirm the news is relevant to the target stock.
Numerical & Categorical Features:
sentiment_score (e.g., -1.0 to +1.0)
news_category (e.g., M&A, Legal, Earnings)
news_volume (How many articles about this topic in the last hour/day?)
source_credibility (A score based on the source, e.g., Bloomberg > blog post)
Model Selection & Training:
Input (X): A time-series vector for each day/stock containing features like: sentiment_score_day_N, sentiment_score_day_N-1, news_category_day_N, etc.
Output (Y): The sharp_move label (1, -1, or 0) for day N.
Models to Test:
Baseline: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost. These are powerful, interpretable, and great for structured data.
Advanced: Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTMs) or Transformers. These are designed for sequential data and can better capture the "pattern over N days" you described.
Training Plan (as you proposed):
Training Set: Years 1 & 2.
Validation/Test Set: Year 3.
Crucial Rule: This must be a chronological split. You cannot randomly shuffle time-series data, as that would let the model "see the future" (lookahead bias), leading to unrealistic performance.
Phase 3: Backtesting & Validation
This is where you rigorously test if the model is actually profitable.
Evaluating Model Correctness:
The 70% Accuracy Trap: Simple accuracy is a poor metric here. Sharp moves are rare. A model that always predicts "no sharp move" will have >95% accuracy but is completely useless.
Better Metrics:
Precision: Of the times the model predicted a sharp move, how often was it correct? This is the most important metric for not losing money.
Recall: Of all the sharp moves that actually happened, how many did the model find?
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.
Building a Realistic Backtest Engine:
Simulate a trading strategy based on your model's signals from the Year 3 data.
Signal: If model predicts sharp_move = 1, buy at market open. If model predicts sharp_move = -1, short-sell at market open.
Realism is Key: The backtest MUST include:
Transaction Costs: Brokerage commissions per trade.
Slippage: The difference between the price you expected and the price you got. For sharp moves, this can be significant.
Bid-Ask Spread: The cost of crossing the spread to execute a trade.
Financial Performance Metrics:
Cumulative Return: Total profit/loss over the backtest period.
Sharpe Ratio: Risk-adjusted return. The higher, the better.
Maximum Drawdown: The largest peak-to-trough drop in your portfolio value. This measures risk.
Phase 4: Deployment & Live Trading
If the backtest results are strong and stable, you can consider live deployment.
Infrastructure: A cloud server (AWS/GCP) running the model.
Data Pipeline: Live, low-latency news and market data feeds.
Execution: An API connection to a brokerage account for automated trade execution.
Risk Management: THIS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE.
Position Sizing: Never risk more than 1-2% of your capital on a single trade.
Stop-Loss Orders: Automatically exit a trade if it moves against you by a predefined amount.
Kill Switch: A manual or automated way to shut down the entire strategy if it starts behaving erratically.
Challenges & The Hard Truth (Why this is hard)
Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH): By the time news is public on a mainstream wire, thousands of professional algorithms have already read and reacted to it in milliseconds. Your "edge" must come from unique interpretation, unique data sources, or focusing on less-covered stocks.
Causation vs. Correlation: The model may find a pattern that isn't causal. A stock may drop, and bad news may come out, but both could be caused by an underlying factor the model doesn't see.
Alpha Decay: A strategy that works today will be discovered by others and arbitraged away. The market adapts. Your model needs to be constantly monitored and retrained.
Data & Computational Costs: High-quality, real-time data is expensive. Training large NLP models requires significant computational power.
Conclusion
Your proposal is an excellent starting point for a professional-grade quantitative trading project. By following a structured, multi-phase approach and focusing obsessively on data quality, realistic backtesting, and robust risk management, you can build a powerful tool.
The goal should be to create an agent that provides a quantifiable statistical edge, increasing your probability of making profitable trades over the long run, rather than a system that is "correct" 100% of the time. This is how real money is made in quantitative finance.

Pulls its historical price and news data.
Trains a simple model to find correlations.
Shows a prediction: "Based on today's news, a sharp move is [LIKELY / UNLIKELY]."
Presents the results in a clean, visual way (like a Jupyter Notebook or a simple web app).


The Tech Stack (Keep it Simple!)
Language: Python 3
Core Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
Data Acquisition: yfinance (for stock prices), newsapi-python (for news)
NLP: TextBlob (for easy sentiment analysis), scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer
Presentation (Choose one):
